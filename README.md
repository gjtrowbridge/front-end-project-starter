# Front-End Project Starter

The purpose of this repository is to give myself a starting point for creating new front-end repos.
I wanted a fast, simple way to get myself up-and-running with Webpack, ES6, SCSS, React, Redux, etc.

There are plenty of great tools already that do this (like [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app)).

The reason I'm building my own, and the only advantages that my tool will have over other tools, is:

* It's a good excuse for me to get more experience with Webpack.
* I can tweak the configuration of this repo to fit my exact needs.
* This repo will only include what I think I need for my projects (fewer moving parts).
* I'll understand all of the "parts" of this repo, and can comment it to my heart's content.

Obviously, anyone else is free to use this, but you may get better mileage with one of the more widely-used tools.
